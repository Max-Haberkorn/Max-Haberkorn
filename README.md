# About Me

- Iâ€™m working on my Master's Degree right now
- Iâ€™m learning about Python and developing my skills with SQL, Tableau, and R

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that's going to help develop my skills
- I'm gonna need a job soon too, so if you want to help me there that'd be chill
  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Idk, I'm not putting my number or email on here so just message me or something

- My biggest interests are sports, real estate, and animals
  -  Primarily Bears & Buffs, Residential, and dogs, respectively

I really just want to continue developing my skills and getting nice with Python. I don't think I'll ever be the best in the world, but I know I can get good.
